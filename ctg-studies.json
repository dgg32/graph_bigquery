It will compare two induction chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone and cytarabine (current standard treatment) with liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine. This will test liposomal daunorubicin, which is believed to be less cardiotoxic than similar conventional drugs, although this is unproven. (Randomisation 1 (R1) closed early to recruitment on 8th September 2017, due to liposomal daunorubicin manufacturing issues resulting in unavailability of the drug.)\n\nPatients responding well to induction chemotherapy are eligible for a randomisation of two consolidation regimens: high dose cytarabine (current standard treatment) or fludarabine and cytarabine (FLA); a regimen commonly used in patients with relapsed disease, testing whether FLA is more effective in front line therapy than standard consolidation treatment. Patients with cytogenetic features associated with a higher risk of relapse and those responding sub-optimally to induction treatment are candidates for haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are eligible for a randomisation comparing two HSCT conditioning regimens: myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (current UNited Kingdom (UK) standard) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). HSCT has not consistently shown benefit in high risk patients because the mortality associated with the procedure has outweighed the advantage from a reduction in relapse risk. This will test whether reducing the intensity of conditioning improves survival by reducing transplant related deaths without increasing the relapse rate. The trial incorporates a dose finding study for gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The aim is to identify the optimum tolerated number of doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (up to a total of 3 doses), which can be safely combined with either of the induction chemotherapy regimens and then to compare this number of doses with one dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The intensity of treatment will be directed by cytogenetics/molecular genetics and response assessed by minimal residual disease (MRD) levels measured by flow cytometry and molecular methodology."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Myeloid Leukaemia"],"keywords":["Acute Myeloid Leukaemia","Children","Gemtuzumab ozogamicin","Liposomal daunorubicin","Mitoxantrone","Randomised

For the first time, an algorithm will be proposed for diagnosing the state of endothelial function in patients with ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase when using therapy with the II generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib, based on the use of a multifactorial method of mathematical modeling.\n\nPractical significance Indicators will be determined that reflect the state of the vasoregulatory function of the endothelium in patients with ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase when using therapy with II generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors bosutinib.\n\nTaking into account the identified changes, an algorithm will be developed for assessing the state of endothelial function in patients with ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase when using the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib.\n\nExpected results Based on a comprehensive analysis of indicators of endothelial vasoregulatory function, including biochemical parameters and an assessment of the information content of the laser Doppler flowmetry method, an algorithm for assessing the state of endothelial function in patients with ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase against the background of taking the II generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib will be developed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia"],"keywords":["chronic myeloid leukaemia","tyrosine kinase inhibitor","endothelium","endothelial

Although transplant associated mortality was reduced after HSCT in the last decade due to better HLA matching, infection prevention and control, the burden of late complications is still a matter of concern. Growth retardation, hormonal dysfunction, sterility and the risk of secondary cancer are the late consequences of TBI in children. However, so far no prospective study has demonstrated similar outcomes in paediatric ALL using chemo-conditioning regimen before HSCT. The reason for that is manifold: only a minority of children with ALL qualifies for allogeneic HSCT as most patients are cured with sole modern chemotherapy approaches. Those with dismal prognosis are treated in HSCT centres offering a care to patients with different diseases. Therefore it is nearly impossible to answer the complex outcome questions in single centres or even in single countries. International cooperation is essential to allow prospective investigation within comparable patient cohorts.\n\nThis study aimed to explore the efficacy and efficiency of two different chemo-conditioning regimens (Flu/Thio with Treo or ivBu) in comparison to the standard conditioning regimen (TBI/VP16). All patients with an indication for HSCT, age \\> 4 years and a matched donor (MD) or matched sibling donor (MSD) underwent a randomisation between these two conditioning regimens. The decision if the irradiation free conditioning is Flu/Thio/Treo or Flu/Thio/ivBu was stratified by country. Patients with age \\< 4 years received the irradiation free conditioning. Patients with a mismatched donor were stratified according to the donor's stem cell source (cordblood, haploidentical tx or bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cells).\n\nAfter an interim analysis of the randomized FORUM-trial in December 2018, which showed superior OS for TBI/Etoposide with equal outcomes for Bu or Treo-containing regimen, the randomization was suspended. The reason was less relapse incidence whereas 1-year TRM was comparable in all 3 arms. The randomization was closed in March 2019 based on the results of additional analyses confirming the superiority of TBI/VP16 over chemo-conditioning. Consequently, the TBI conditioning has remained a standard for the patients older than 4 years with a MSD/MD. Use of a conditioning other than TBI/VP16 in this age group is made at the center level based on the assessment of each individual patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia"],"keywords":["stem cell transplantation","children and adolescents","high risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Flu/Thio/Treo","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fludarabine/Thiotepa/Treosulfan is for conditioning before HSCT from MSD or MD.

Longer term invasive infection AMR monitoring will include sensitivity testing of all organisms isolated in confirmed infection for the duration of ALLTogether-1.\n\nThe primary outcome is the rate of sterile site bacterial infections during induction, evaluated by intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes include rates of febrile episodes, febrile neutropenia, severe infection and infection-related death; rates of AMR; antibiotic exposure; secondary infections; and quinolone side effects.

Once patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will have cells collected by leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART22 manufacturing, unless adequate numbers of cells are available from a prior apheresis. Cells will be transduced with the anti-CD22 TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. Cryopreserved historical apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are usable for CART22 manufacturing if collected at an appropriately certified apheresis center and the product meets adequate mononuclear cell yields. If a historical apheresis product is not available, an apheresis procedure will be scheduled for cell procurement after study entry.\n\nUnless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, patients will be given conditioning chemotherapy prior to CART22 cell infusion with the intent of lymphodepletion. Additionally, if the patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is ≤ 1,000 /uL, conditioning/lymphodepleting chemotherapy is NOT required. The chemotherapy will be planned so that the last dose is completed 1-4 days BEFORE the planned infusion of CART22 cells. The chemotherapy start date will vary based on the duration of the selected chemotherapy regimen. If the period from chemotherapy to CART22 infusion is delayed 4 or more weeks, the patient will need to be re-treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CART22 infusion.\n\nWe will enroll 15 evaluable patients for the primary safety endpoint analysis. Primary safety evaluable patients are those who have received any CART22 cells. The first three subjects infused with CART22 will be staggered by 14 days to allow for monitoring of adverse events, including CRS.\n\nSubjects with a manufactured cell dose that is less than the protocol-specified dose will be scored as a manufacturing failure. These subjects will receive their cell infusion, provided that all other manufacturing release criteria are met.\n\nAll patients will have blood tests to assess CART22 safety, engraftment and persistence at regular intervals throughout the study (Visit Evaluation Schedule in Appendix 1). Circulating CART22 T cells subsets will be assessed at various times after infusion. CART22 trafficking will be assessed in bone marrow aspirates, and other tissues, if available. Follow up is planned at a minimum of weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 6 months, then patients will be followed quarterly for the remainder of the year to obtain a medical history, undergo a physical examination, and blood tests. Additional samples collections and assessments between schedule visits after CART22 cell infusion will be performed as clinically indicated.\n\nFollowing these evaluations, patients will enter a roll-over study for long term follow-up for up to an additional fourteen years to assess for safety assessments per the FDA guidelines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["B Cell Leukemias","B Cell Lymphomas"],"keywords":["Biological: CART 22"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CART22 cells","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects \\<50kg will receive 0.2-1 x 10\\^7 CART22 cells/kg as a split dose over three days as follows:\n\n* Day 1, 10% fraction: 0.2-1x10\\^6 CART22 cells/kg\n* Day 2, 30% fraction: 0.6-3x10\\^6 CART22 cells/kg\n* Day 3, 60% fraction: 1.2-6x10\\^6 CART22 cells/kg\n\nSubjects ≥50kg will receive 1-5x10\\^8 CART22 cells as a split dose over three days as follows:\n\n* Day 1, 10% fraction: 1-5x10\\^7\n* Day 2, 30% fraction: 0.3-1.5x10\\^8\n* Day 3, 60% fraction: 0.6-3x10\\^8","interventionNames":["Biological: CART22 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD22 scFv TCRz:41BB"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"CART22 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD22 scFv TCRz:41BB","armGroupLabels":["CART22 cells"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency and severity of adverse events, including, but not limited to, cytokine release syndrome (CRS)","description":"grade 3 and higher toxicity rate (toxicity possibly attributed to CART22)","timeFrame":"From date of dosing ( day 1 ) up to 50 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of manufacturing products that do not meet release criteria.","description":"Product must pass for vector transduction efficiency, T cell product purity, viability, sterility or due to tumor contamination.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Overall Complete Remission Rate (ORR) at Day 28.","description":"Includes CR and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)","timeFrame":"4 months"},{"measure":"Evaluate overall response rate (CR/CRi by or at Month 6) at Month 6.","timeFrame":"9 months"},{"measure":"Evaluate disease status at Month 6.","timeFrame":"9 months"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","timeFrame":"at 50 weeks"},{"measure":"Duration of remission (DOR)","timeFrame":"at 50 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of subjects with relapse free survival (RFS)","timeFrame":"at 50 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of subjects with event free survival (EFS).","timeFrame":"at 50 weeks"},{"measure":"Describe cause of death (COD) when appropriate","timeFrame":"15 years"},{"measure":"Describe response in terms of minimal residual disease (MRD).","description":"Percentage of patients who achieve a CR associated with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative bone marrow as determined by high sensitivity flow cytometry.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Incidence of any acute GVHD","timeFrame":"15 year"},{"measure":"Incidence of any grade II-IV GVHD","timeFrame":"15 year"},{"measure":"Incidence any chronic GVHD.","timeFrame":"15 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The new product is made from white blood cells (T cells) collected from a healthy donor and changed so they can kill leukaemia cells. These 'ready-made' CAR T cells have been made using a new technique called Base Editing to modify their DNA code and have been given the code name 'BE CAR-33'. This technique allows them to work after chemotherapy and also disarms them to prevent effects against normal cells. The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety of the 'BE CAR-33' therapy and to see if ready-made CAR T cells can get rid of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ahead of a planned bone marrow transplant that will hopefully prevent the leukaemia from returning.","detailedDescription":"Who can participate? Patients aged 6 months to 16 years with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia ahead of a planned bone marrow transplant.\n\nWhat does the study involve? Patients will undergo careful screening to confirm that this treatment is adequate for them. Chemotherapy will be given prior to BE CAR-33 infusion to improve the ability of T-cells to establish and grow. Patients will then receive a single infusion of the BE CAR-33 cells. They will be closely monitored via blood and bone marrow tests for safety and to check the levels of BE CAR-33 and leukaemia cells. The investigators expect patients to be in hospital for 5 weeks for the BE CAR-33 therapy and the transplant will be scheduled 4 weeks after the end of BE CAR33. Patients will be monitored every month for the first three months and then every 6 months.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Taking part in the study of testing 'ready-made' CAR T cells could help reduce the amount of disease and get the patient into remission before a planned bone marrow transplant. Leukaemia is less likely to come back after a bone marrow transplant if levels in the bone marrow are undetectable. The ready-made CAR T cells are being used to try and improve the chances of successful transplantation. Side effects may include low blood cell counts, infections, cytokine storm (severe immune reaction), graft versus host disease (where the donated cells attack the body) and other complications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 1, open label, non-randomised","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single dose intravenous infusion of a banded dose of CAR33+ T Cells/Kg BECAR33","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will undergo careful screening to confirm that this treatment is appropriate for them.

All subjects enrolled will receive the IP recombinant ASNase (Spectrila®). Since Spectrila is already approved in the European Economic Area for first-line treatment of ALL patients of all age groups and showed similar efficacy and safety in comparison to Asparaginase medac no blinding or control groups are necessary. As underlying treatment protocol the BRALL 2014 treatment protocol will be used.","detailedDescription":"The BRALL (Brazilian Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia) treatment protocol was developed to standardise adult ALL treatment in Brazil since previously each centre used a different protocol. As in other treatment regimens of study groups, ASNase is an important component of ALL therapy. The rationale of the BRALL protocol was to use less myelotoxic drugs as daunorubicin, etoposide and cyclophosphamide and focus on more specific ALL directed therapies as asparaginase and methotrexate. The higher asparaginase dose regimen was chosen in BRALL 2014 to strengthen ASNase as major component of the treatment protocol while etoposide administration is reduced. Native ASNase is widely used and the data investigating non-inferiority, safety and tolerability of Asparaginase medac vs. Spectrila received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Nevertheless, data on efficacy and safety of Spectrila in adults are limited. Therefore, robust data on PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and immunogenicity of Spectrila will be investigated in this trial in subjects with de novo ALL. The measurement of ASNase activity is considered to correlate with clinical effectiveness and therefore chosen as primary objective.\n\nSubjects eligible for participation in this clinical trial will be treated with 3 intravenous doses of Spectrila of 10 000 U/m² BSA each during induction phase I of the underlying BRALL 2014 treatment protocol. Spectrila will be administered on Days 21, 23 and 25. Additionally, the subjects (standard risk subjects only) will receive doses of 10 000 U/m² BSA Spectrila each on Days 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 13 of the consolidation phase II, III and VI of BRALL 2014 treatment protocol.

However, its use entails significant infectious complications and high risks of death.The hypothesis is that increasing the rate of PICCline dressing changes will reduce the occurrence of catheter-related infections.","detailedDescription":"The PICCline (\"Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter\") is a central catheter whose brachial insertion is peripheral. It has been widely used for many years for the administration of chemotherapy to patients with cancer. Although its use is growing (2.7 million applications in the USA in 2020), significant infectious complications (especially bacteremia) and even high risks of death are generally associated with it.\n\nIn December 2013, the French Society of Hospital Hygiene (SF2H) published a guide of \"Recommendations for good practices and management of risks associated with PICC\" to help professionals in the use of this device. It states that the rate of dressing repair is set at a maximum of 8 days for a sterile semipermeable transparent dressing; however, this recommendation is based on a questionable level of evidence (grade E level of evidence according to the HAS). In the appendix to this guide, the analysis of the scientific literature does not highlight any articles comparing different dressing repair rates. An observational study was conducted at the University Hospital of Nîmes, in order to determine the rate of infection on PICCline in the Hematology Department. In 2019, out of the 90 PICClines applied (dressing changes every 2 days), 12 infections (local and/or systemic) were noted, i.e. 13.3%.\n\nIn order to know the current practices of the different hematology services in France, a survey was conducted to collect protocols for PICCline dressing changes. A total of 23 haematology departments were contacted, 18 of which responded. The observation was made that, although most departments respected the SF2H recommendation (15 out of 18), others proposed different rhythms of care: (a) in the Hematology department at Nîmes University Hospital, dressings are redone every 48 hours, (b) in Montpellier, the frequency was 2 to 3 times a week, (c) in Grenoble, the use of PICCline was abandoned by the medical team who noted too many infections and thromboses associated with this device, and (d) in Toulouse and Strasbourg, the PICCline was used less and less for these same reasons. Moreover, the SF2H recommendations are addressed in a general way to professionals and valid for all patients; but no study can currently affirm that they are applicable to a fragile population of immunocompromised patients in the context of intensive chemotherapy. Hematology patients have a high risk of febrile neutropenia, of around 80%, and this risk of immunosuppression is a non-negligible point in terms of infection prevention during patient management.\n\nIn 2019 in France, the Réseau de Prévention des Infections Associées aux Soins launched a campaign to monitor and prevent infections associated with invasive devices. For 3 months, data on the occurrence of infectious episodes were collected in 1001 healthcare facilities. Of the nearly 12,000 bacteremia episodes identified, 25.4% were associated with an intravascular device, 17% of which were PICCline. Moreover, the survey revealed that the highest rates of occurrence were found in the Intensive Care Unit, Oncology and Hematology departments and the prevalence of bacteremia associated with intravascular devices in Hematology represented 39.8%.\n\nHypothesis : increasing the rate of PICCline dressing changes will reduce the occurrence of catheter-related infections."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia"],"keywords":["Leukemia","Catheters","Dressings"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective two-center randomized open-label controlled pilot study in two parallel groups according to PICCline dressing repair: (i) Control group (every 8 days, see SF2H recommendations), (ii) Experimental group (every 2 days).","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receiving normal management with dressings changed once a week according to the SF2H recommendations.","interventionNames":["Other: Dressing change"]},{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients whose dressings are changed every other day.","interventionNames":["Other: Dressing change"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dressing change","description":"The patient circuit corresponds to that of usual care.\n\nNot part of usual patient management:\n\n* The rhythm of PICCline dressing changes, which differed between the two groups.\n* The collection of pain on a visual analog scale at each dressing change.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of local and/or systemic occurrence of infection on the PICCline in controls","description":"Occurrence of infection on the PICCline, local and/or systemic, and its time of occurrence according to the definition of the Technical Committee on Nosocomial Infections and Healthcare-Associated Infections (CTINILS) during intensive treatment, from the beginning of induction chemotherapy to the beginning of the first consolidation.

These patients generally need treatment intensification and a bone marrow transplantation (BMT).\n\nNevertheless, with conventional treatent the risk of relapse after transplant remains high.\n\nRadioimmunotherapy provides a way to deliver high dose irradiation to the bone marrow (where leukaemia resides), while sparing normal organs and tissues from its toxicity.This can be achieved by linking a radioactive molecule (Yttrium90) to an antibody that, once infused in the blood, targets marrow/leukemic cells.","detailedDescription":"In our Phase 1 trial which concluded in 2019, 9 children affected by refractory or relapsed leukaemia were enrolled at Great Ormond Street Hospital or UCLH. Participants received infusion of a tumour cell targeting antibody to deliver irradiation to the bone marrow and sites containing leukemic blasts prior to BMT. The aim of the Phase 1 study was to identify the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of targeted radiotherapy, and it was found that this treatment was well tolerated with minimal infusion-related side effects.\n\nThe current study will enrol a larger cohort of children (aged 0.5 - 18 years) who will receive 90Yttrium administered at an infused activity to target the optimal absorbed dose to the bone marrow. Patients will be treated at GOSH and UCLH and followed up for 12 months post-BMT to evaluate safety and efficacy of targeted radiotherapy with a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen prior to BMT.\n\nPURPOSE AND DESIGN OF THE STUDY Children with high risk or relapsed leukaemia have a poor prognosis with an increased risk of relapse after standard bone marrow transplant. There is an urgent need to offer a different therapeutic strategy for children with such poor risk diseases.\n\nThere is evidence that targeted radioimmunotherapy prior to a stem cell transplantation is a feasible and effective treatment that delivers high dose radiation to the bone marrow and spleen (where leukaemia resides),while sparing other tissues and organs from its toxicity. Since leukaemic cells are generally radiosensitive, this approach might increase leukaemia-free survival, while reducing transplant-related morbidity and mortality.\n\nOur previous phase 1 radio-immunotherapy study demonstrated that radio-immunotherapy is non-toxic, but can elicit myelosuppression, with potential for better disease eradication.\n\nThis protocol offers a novel and non-toxic therapeutic strategy to children with poor risk leukaemia and aims at reducing the risk of disease relapse after transplant.\n\nRECRUITMENT and CONSENT Children with poor risk leukaemia who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study might be recruited in this trial. Patients and/or their parents will receive appropriate information from one of the investigators regarding the rationale of this study, the possible risks and benefits and the alternatives to taking part. Patients and/or their parents will be given an age appropriate information sheet and consent form and they will be given the time to think about this.\n\nINCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA Children enrolled in this study must be affected by high risk or relapsed/refractory leukaemia, with a high risk of disease relapse after conventional transplant. Children eligible for this treatment must also be clinically fit for an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to clinical and laboratory parameters, which have been specified in details in the protocol.\n\nRISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS Patients eligible for this trial are affected by high risk or relapsed/refractory leukaemia and have an indication to an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplantation carries a significant risk of morbidity/mortality, due to: a)the toxicity of the preparative regimen, b) the posttransplant immunodeficiency with high risk of opportunistic infections, and c) the possible occurrence of graft versus host disease. The use of radioimmunotherapy in the context of a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen prior to the transplantation has proved to be feasible and safe in adult and paediatric studies, without a significant increase of the treatment related toxicity when compared to standard conditioning regimen.\n\nMoreover, higher doses of radiation delivered to patients with leukaemia generate a better leukaemia response and this approach in children with poor risk leukaemia is promising.\n\nChildren undergoing this treatment will be carefully followed up and haematological (prolonged cytopaenia, stromal damage) and nonhaematological (mucositis, liver and kidney damage)toxicity will be monitored and recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"90-Yttrium-labelled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The medicinal product consists of the murine IgG1 anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody radio-labelled with 111In for imaging and dosimetry and with 90Y for therapy.\n\nDosage indications The \\[111In\\]-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody (MAb) will be given at an infused activity of 100MBq/sqm between 1-4 weeks before the therapeutic dose of radiolabelled antibody.\n\n\\[90Y\\]-yttrium-labeled anti-CD66 MAb will be given as a single infusion on day - 14 prior to transplant. \\[90Y\\]-yttrium labelled anti-CD66 MAb will be given to target an absorbed dose to the bone marrow of 45 Gy +/- 10%.

To assess the germline configuration of the patient, DNA from fingernail clippings will be investigated.","detailedDescription":"Background Single or multiple point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia represent the most important known mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It is conceivable that pre-existing point mutations in CML stem cells attributable to the genomic instability conferred by the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein give rise to the outgrowth of resistant subclones and onset of treatment-insensitive disease under the selection pressure of TKI therapy. Early detection of such subclones may therefore be of prognostic and therapeutic relevance. The recently published immunophenotype of CML stem cells (Hermann et al. Blood 2014), and our recent report on an NGS (next-generation sequencing)-based method facilitating sensitive detection and quantitative monitoring of BCR-ABL1 subclones carrying single or compound mutations (Kastner et al. European Journal of Cancer 2014) facilitate the screening for clinically relevant mutant subclones in stem cells or early progenitor cells.\n\nHypothesis Detection of mutant subclones within the stem cell or early progenitor compartments at diagnosis or early into therapy of Ph-positive leukemias, and monitoring of their proliferation kinetics, permit early prediction of resistant disease under the ongoing TKI treatment.\n\nExperimental approach Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples will be collected upon informed consent from patients with Ph-positive leukemia at diagnosis (BM+PB), and subsequently at 3-month intervals (PB;BM upon availability) during the first year of therapy based on or including TKIs. Isolation of CD (cluster of differentiation) 34+ cells carrying additional phenotypic markers characterizing stem cells or early progenitor cells (CD38-/CD25+/CD26+ in CML, CD19 in Ph-ALL) will be performed by flow sorting. The entire BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) will be amplified from cDNA (complementary DNA) or specific exons of interest from DNA by established protocols, and bidirectional sequencing will be performed by ultra-deep sequencing using NGS. Mutant subclones identified at diagnosis or after debulking of most of the treatment-sensitive leukemic burden early into treatment (3 month time point), will be monitored by NGS until month 12 of therapy. BCR-ABL1 transcripts will be monitored according to the International Scale (IS) in parallel. DNA isolated from fingernail clippings will be used as germline control for the ABL1 TKD. The testing will be performed in a blinded fashion to prevent treatment adjustments according to experimental data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"DNA samples from CML patients obtained from bone marrow/peripheral blood and fingernail clippings"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Leukemic stem/progenitor cells defined by a specific marker profile will be isolated from BM/PB by flow sorting.

The patients in this study will be presented the opportunity to use VR instead of undergo GA for a LP. Success will be defined as successful performance of the procedure with VR instead of GA.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to administer questionnaires to all patients approached for the trial if they are willing, even if they decide not to use VR for their LP. These questionnaires are listed below.\n\nStudies have linked the use of technology with decreased distress, increased cooperation, and improved pain management. For example, pediatric patients who had access to a video game to engage for distraction during anesthesia induction for surgery were less distressed and more cooperative during mask induction. In children and adolescents requiring port access VR distraction was significantly better than standard of care in terms of reducing physiological arousal (i.e., pulse rate) and pain ratings. VR has been utilized effectively in the management of pediatric and adult wound care, burn care, and dressing changes. Patients who had dressing changes while immersed in VR used less pain medication, had lower pain scores and often requested to use VR for future dressing changes all while having their procedures take less time. Simple distraction techniques might not be enough. One study evaluated the effectiveness of using augmented reality with children undergoing burn dressing changes. They compared augmented reality to standard distraction with an age appropriate video game. The study found augmented reality reduced pain scores significantly better than video game distraction.\n\nWhen not accompanied by appropriate pain control, stressful and invasive medical procedures can lead to posttraumatic stress symptoms and negative reactions or noncompliance to subsequent medical experiences. Specifically, adults who experienced more medical fear and pain as children were more likely to rate their adult medical fear and pain higher and avoid medical care. Pharmacological strategies alone are often not enough to effectively manage a child's pain. Non-pharmacological pain management uses alternative strategies, such as distraction, to replace or augment medication to help reduce a child's pain. VR systems have been successfully trialed in a small number of patients, mostly adolescents and adults. VR has reliably demonstrated decreased pain, anxiety, suffering, time spent thinking about pain and perceived time spent in a medical procedure.\n\nTypically, VR has to be experienced seated upright or standing with few exceptions because of the design of the software. Patients underoing LP are often required to lay laterally, as is the case with this study. Therefore, we will be using VR software (Pebbles the Penguin and SpacePups, Weightless Studios) that is age appropriate for the study population, engaging enough for young adults, and designed to be reoriented to the patient's position.\n\nThe goal of this feasibility study is to determine if VR can be adequately used as an alternative to GA for LP. Utilizing distraction will eliminate the risk associated with general anesthesia, and the accompanying inconvenience of general anesthetic exposure on these patients perioperatively, as well as long term. Additionally, we wish to decrease the burden of cost for these procedures as currently practiced. LPs performed under GA require the presence of an anesthesiologist, medications, and recovery staff, all of which add increased cost to the procedure. With this VR system, there is a one time cost associated with the purchase of the system (in our case, the VR system was donated to our hospital by a non-profit called The Starlight Foundation), and the system can be used multiple times on multiple patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GA for LP","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients who decline to undergo an LP with VR will be asked if they would be willing to participate by answering questionnaires specific to their pre procedure anxiety.

It is not currently approved for treating your disease.\n\nTalazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein called poly (adenosine diphosphate \\[ADP\\]-ribose) polymerase or PARP. PARP is involved in repairing damage to the DNA within your cells. DNA is the set of instructions found within all of your cells that tells them how to behave. The DNA is damaged all the time by things around in the environment, and is repaired by several different methods, one of which uses PARP. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in the normal cells, other methods can still work to repair damage to DNA. However, in some cancer cells these other methods are broken and cannot be used. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in these cancer cells, DNA damage cannot be repaired and leads to the death of the cancer cells. Talazoparib is a drug that is safe and active in breast cancer and gynecologic cancers. However, there were no responses among 33 unselected patients with hematologic malignancies, including 21 with AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and 4 with MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), when they received treatment with Talazoparib by itself. It is not known if there were any patients with cohesin-mutations that were on the clinical trial (these mutations are rare).\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are testing if Talazoparib is an effective treatment for patients with AML and MDS that have a mutation in the cohesin complex. The cohesin complex is made up of a group of proteins that are critical for normal DNA replication activity. Mutations in the cohesin complex occur in patients with MDS/AML and may represent a new therapeutic target. In a chemical screen experiment in a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute laboratory, the investigators found that leukemia cells featuring a mutated cohesin complex were sensitive to Talazoparib (meaning the leukemia cells went away after treatment with Talazoparib) by a mechanism called synthetic lethality (this means that the lab experiments showed that leukemia cells with a mutation in cohesin were dependent on PARP activity to survive; when inhibiting PARP with a PARP inhibitor like Talazoparib, the leukemia cells died). The investigators thus identified Talazoparib to be a possible treatment for actual patients with MDS or AML that have a mutation in cohesin complex."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia"],"keywords":["Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Talazoparib Part I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Talazoparib is administered orally on a daily basis\n* Hydroxyurea is allowed for up to two cycles per institutional guidelines","interventionNames":["Drug: Talazoparib"]},{"label":"Talazoparib + Decitabine Part II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Talazoparib is administered orally on a daily basis\n* Hydroxyurea is allowed for up to two cycles per institutional guidelines\n* Decitabine on days 1-5","interventionNames":["Drug: Talazoparib","Drug: Decitabine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Talazoparib","description":"Talazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein called poly (adenosine diphosphate \\[ADP\\]-ribose) polymerase or PARP.

This phase I clinical trial will treat children aged 6 months up to 16 years with T cell leukaemia which has come back (relapsed) after chemotherapy or is not responding to chemotherapy (refractory). The cell therapy is made from white blood cells (T cells) collected from a healthy donor and changed so they can kill other T cells, including leukaemia cells. These 'ready-made' CAR T cells have been made using a new technique called CRISPR base editing to modify them DNA code and have been given the name BE CAR-7. This technique allows them to work after chemotherapy and also disarms them to prevent effects against normal cells. The main aim of this study is to assess the safety of the BE CAR-7 treatment and to see if ready-made CAR T cells can eradicate T cell leukaemia ahead of a planned bone marrow transplant.","detailedDescription":"Who can participate? Patients aged 6 months to 16 years with relapsed/refractory T cell leukaemia ahead of a planned bone marrow transplant\n\nWhat does the study involve? Patients will undergo careful screening to confirm that this treatment is adequate for them. Chemotherapy will be given prior to BE CAR-7 infusion to improve the ability of T-cells to establish and grow. Patients will then receive a single infusion of the BE CAR-7 cells and will be closely monitored in hospital. Patients are expected to be in hospital for 4-6 weeks for the BE CAR-7 treatment and the transplant will be scheduled 2-4 weeks after the end of BE CAR7 if leukaemia cells are no longer detectable. Patients will be monitored on the study for 1 year after transplant and then long term in routine clinics.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Taking part in the study of testing 'ready-made' CAR T cells could help reduce the amount of disease and get the patient into remission before a bone marrow transplant. Leukaemia is less likely to come back after a bone marrow transplant if levels in the bone marrow are undetectable. The ready-made CAR T cells are being used to try and improve the chances of successful transplantation. Side effects may include low blood cell counts, infections, cytokine storm (severe immune reaction), graft versus host disease (where the donated cells attack the body) and other complications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Relapsed/Refractory T-cell Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 1, open label, non randomised","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Not applicable (Open Label)"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single-dose intravenous infusion of a banded dose of CAR7+ T cells/kg BECAR7","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single-dose intravenous infusion (weight-based dosing) of CAR7+ T cells/kg BECAR7 Total duration of treatment: 28 days Follow-up: 12 months Patients will undergo careful screening to confirm that this treatment is adequate for them.

It mainly affects the elderly with an aggressive clinical course. It is a hemopathy exhibiting a post thymic T phenotype (Tdt-, CD1a-, CD5 +, CD2 + and CD7 +), generally CD4 + / CD8-, but also CD4 + / CD8 + or CD8 + / CD4-.\n\nThe main feature of T-PLL is the rearrangement of chromosome 14 involving genes encoding the T cell receptor complex (TCR) subunits, leading to overexpression of the proto-oncogene TCL1.\n\nOn the molecular level, the study of Prolymphocytic leukemia T shows a substantial mutational activation of the IL2RG-JAK1-JAK3-STAT5B axis.\n\nPatients with Prolymphocytic leukemia T have a poor prognosis, due to a poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Treatment with the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody: alemtuzumab has considerably improved the results, but the responses to treatment are transient; therefore, patients who obtain a response to alemtuzumab treatment are candidates for stem cell allograft (TSS) if they are eligible for this procedure. This combined approach extended the median survival to four years or more. However, new approaches using well-tolerated therapies that target signaling and survival pathways are necessary for most patients who are unable to receive intensive chemotherapy, such as JAK STAT axis inhibitors, anti-AKT, or anti BCL2 .\n\nMain objective: Better manage prolymphocytic T leukemias.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* Molecular characterization of prolymphocytic leukemia T.\n* Study of the response to treatment, disease-free survival, overall survival.\n* Impact of prognostic factors on response to treatment, and survival."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prolymphocytic Leukemia","T-cell Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"bone marrow and peripheral blood cells"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Molecular caracterization","description":"Prospective and retrospective study evaluating the epidemiological, clinical, molecular and therapeutic data of prolymphocytic leukemias T"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical characteristics of prolymphocytic leukemia T","description":"pathology description at diagnosis and its evolution over time","timeFrame":"from day 0 through study completion, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Biological characteristics of prolymphocytic leukemia T","description":"Blood count : Hemoglobin, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Platelets, Eosinophils (giga / liters)","timeFrame":"At day 0 and at relapse, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Flow cytometry data of bone marrow and blood cells","description":"Positive or negative immunophenotyping","timeFrame":"At day 0 and at relapse, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"karyotype of tumor cells","description":"karyotipic formula","timeFrame":"At day 0 and at relapse, an average of 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Man or woman aged 18 or over\n* Patient with prolymphocytic T leukemia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Absence of signature of informed consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient with prolymphocytic T leukemia","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Charles HERBAUX, Dr","role":"CONTACT","phone":"3 20 44 57 13","phoneExt":"+33","email":"Charles.herbaux@chru-lille.fr"},{"name":"Alexandra FAYAULT","role":"CONTACT","email":"a.fayault@filo-leucemie.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kamel LARIBI, Dr","affiliation":"French Innovative Leukemia Organisation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chd Le Mans","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Le Mans","zip":"72000","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Kamel LARIBI, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33243434361","email":"klaribi@ch-lemans.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.0,"lon":0.2}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2023-11-07","modelPredictions":{"bmiLimits":{"minBmi":0.00,"maxBmi":101.00}}},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000007938","term":"Leukemia"},{"id":"D000015458","term":"Leukemia, T-Cell"},{"id":"D000015463","term":"Leukemia, Prolymphocytic"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000007945","term":"Leukemia, Lymphoid"},{"id":"D000008232","term":"Lymphoproliferative Disorders"},{"id":"D000008206","term":"Lymphatic Diseases"},{"id":"D000007160","term":"Immunoproliferative Disorders"},{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10635","name":"Leukemia","asFound":"Leukemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17812","name":"Leukemia, Prolymphocytic","asFound":"Prolymphocytic Leukemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17809","name":"Leukemia, T-Cell","asFound":"T-cell leukemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12005","name":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10641","name":"Leukemia, Lymphoid","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10915","name":"Lymphoproliferative Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10893","name":"Lymphatic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9896","name":"Immunoproliferative Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9890","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T3393","name":"Leukemia, T-cell, Chronic","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC15","name":"Blood and Lymph Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false},

Misdiagnosis is very common with delay in diagnosis and prompt treatment being the causes of high morbidity and mortality in acute leukaemias.\n\nAlthough with the continuous improvement of clinical and laboratory diagnosis and treatment methods, the prognosis of AML has been significantly improved, but there are still about 70% of patients who cannot survive more than 5 years after diagnosis The activity of miRNAs in tumors is regulated by the same alterations affecting protein-coding genes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, genomic amplifications or deletions or mutations, abnormal transcriptional control, dysregulation of epigenetic changes and defects in the biogenesis machinery A typical chromosomal rearrangement is a chromosomal translocation, especially in hematological malignancies, in which it promotes tumor development and progression by the promoter exchange or by the creation of chimeric genes translated as fusion proteins. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients with myeloid/lymphoid leukemia gene (or mixed-lineage leukemia, MLL) rearrangement, by large-scale genome-wide microarray analysis, it was demonstrated that among 48 selected miRNAs, 47 of them are increased"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","description":"represents the control group ( ITP cases","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: BM aspirate"]},{"label":"AL group","description":"cases of AcuteLeukemia.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: BM aspirate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"BM aspirate","description":"Bone Marrow aspiration \\& Examination","armGroupLabels":["AL group","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of miRNA-155","description":"Detection of miRNA-155 using real time PCR on bone marrow aspirate samples","timeFrame":"one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* approval to sign an informed written consent, patient with newly diagnosed AL.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Refusal to sign an informed written consent, Cases with Chronic leukemias, Lymphoma or Leukemic phase of lymphoma or patients on chemotherapy.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Group (I): represents the control group ( ITP cases).

In addition, there is lack of data comparing oral- As2O3-based regimens with other treatment approaches, including intravenous As2O3,in the frontline or relapsed setting. With the long-term data of oral-As2O3 based regimen for APL available from Hong Kong, retrospective and prospective comparison with other treatment approaches in other Asian countries will generate important information to pave the way for widespread application of oral-As2O3 outside Hong Kong.","detailedDescription":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by t(15;17)(q24;21) and the fusion gene PML-RARA.1 In newly-diagnosed patients, optimal supportive care together with the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy results in first complete remission (CR1) in excess of 90% with durable remissions in about 80% of patients.Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) given intravenously (i.v.-As2O3) is highly efficacious for APL in first relapse (R1), inducing second complete remission (CR2) in more than 90% of patients. We have formulated an oral preparation of As2O3 (oral-As2O3), and shown that it is efficacious for APL in R1, giving CR2 rates of more than 90% in both adults and children. For patients in CR2, a 2-year maintenance with oral-As2O3 results in durable remission and long-term survivals in more than 60% and 70% of patients respectively strongly suggesting that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be obviated in such patients. With these results, we implemented oral-As2O3 maintenance in CR1 in Hong Kong and demonstrated very favourable overall-survival (OS) and leukemia-free-survival (LFS). This implied that that prolonged oral-As2O3 treatment may prevent relapses.\n\nMeanwhile, i.v.-As2O3 has also been tested in the frontline treatment of newly-diagnosed APL.These studies employed different strategies, recruiting a mixture of low-, intermediate- to high-risk patients and placing i.v.-As2O3 in induction and/or consolidation. During induction, i.v.-As2O3 was combined with ATRA, with additional gemtuzumab ozogamicin (an anti-CD33 immunoconjugate) or chemotherapy. During consolidation, i.v.-As2O3 was combined with conventional chemotherapy. Their results all indicated that frontline use of i.v.-As2O3 in induction and/or consolidation improved the outcome of newly-diagnosed APL patients. However, with quite diverse protocols and the enrollment in some studies of only patients with low to intermediate risks, and in other studies of patients with all risk categories; the optimal strategy of employing i.v.-As2O3 in newly-diagnosed APL remains to be defined. We have tested oral- As2O3 in combination with ATRA, ascorbic acid (AAA) with daunorubicin in both low-risk and high-risk APL with 3 year LFS and OS of both 100%.\n\nWith the impressive results of oral-As2O3-based regimen in newly diagnosed and relapsed APL, an important future perspective is the application of this relatively economical and convenient approach to the treatment of patients with APL in Asia and other developing countries around the world where the cost and availability of intravenous formulation of As2O3 is a concern. There is currently lack of collaborative data on the epidemiology, clinicopathologic features and treatment outcome of newly diagnosed and relapsed APL in Asia. In addition, there is lack of data comparing oral- As2O3-based regimens with other treatment approaches, including intravenous As2O3,in the frontline or relapsed setting. With the long-term data of oral-As2O3 based regimen for APL available from Hong Kong, retrospective and prospective comparison with other treatment approaches in other Asian countries will generate important information to pave the way for widespread application of oral-As2O3 outside Hong Kong."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survivals","description":"The primary outcome measures in this study include the overall survival (OS) and the relapse-free survival (RFS).

To identify changes in anti-leukemia immune responses after local radiotherapy to extramedullary sites.\n\nII. Develop an annotated biospecimen panel of extramedullary leukemia biopsies prior to and after radiotherapy to examine local immune responses using transcriptional profiling, immunofluorescence and single cell analyses.\n\nIII. Define changes in the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes, functionality and inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and serum.\n\nIV. Correlate changes in anti-tumor immune responses with clinic-pathological variables and patient outcomes.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the overall response rate (ORR= complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\]) of the extramedullary tumor treated with radiation therapy.\n\nII. To assess the CR of extramedullary tumor treated with radiation therapy. III. Determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo biopsy prior to radiation therapy and 7-14 days after radiation therapy. Patients also undergo blood sample collection prior to therapy (within 7 days of starting radiation therapy), 1 and 7 days post completion of radiation therapy.

This research aims to investigate:\n\n* An association between the rate of innate CD8+ T cells and the evolution of Phi+ pathologies (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute lymphocytic leukemia (Phi+ ALL) carrying a resistance mutation, according to the ELN 2013 and Phi LMC recommendations.\n* An association between the level of innate CD8+ T cells and the expansion of TKI resistance clones, assessed as the number of BcrAbl1 copies carrying the mutation relative to the number of Abl1 copies.","detailedDescription":"Before the advent of the first targeted therapies with imatinib in 2000, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the most feared myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS, Philadelphia+), with a median survival of 3 years. Apart from a small percentage of patients who do not respond or respond poorly to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the probability of survival is now very close to that of the general population when patients are on lifelong TKI therapy (leukemic stem cells have low sensitivity to TKIs). Some patients with good response to treatment are likely to consider stopping treatment but just over 50% of them will have to resume it. So many patients will have to take TKIs for life, which poses several problems:\n\n1. - intolerance to the various molecules depending on the toxicity of each one,\n2. - development of resistance to TKIs, characterized by a rise in the percentage of BcrAbl1 fusion RNA, despite treatment or increased dosages.\n\nThere are many causes of these resistances including those known for any molecule:\n\n* pharmacokinetic causes which can be evaluated by the plasma dosage of the molecules;\n* Leukemic cell-related causes: passage into the cell depending on antagonism between influx pump (hOct1) and efflux pumps (MDR1) and failure to bind to the BcrAbl1 target (pharmacodynamics), mainly by mutation of the tyrosine kinase domain of Abl1, exceptionally by amplification of the Abl1 gene.\n\nThese apply to the consolidation phase of Phi+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Phi+ALL).\n\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of BcrAbl1 account for approximately 25 - 30% of the causes of first line treatment resistance, but can reach 50 - 60% of resistance in 2nd line treatment.The presence of these mutations requires a change of molecule, when possible. More than 100 TKD mutations have been described. The development/selection of these mutations affects both first-generation TKIs (imatinib) and second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib). Resistance mutations are even emerging for the third-generation TKIs (ponatinib). Sensitivity profiles are therefore available to help choose the right molecules beyond first-line treatment.\n\nAmong all these mutations, some are particularly fearsome such as T315I (only sensitive to ponatinib) or T315M or L (resistant to all molecules, including ponatinib). Nîmes University Hospital is one of the seven centers of the 2005 STIC program devoted to searching for TDK mutations. In 2018, we had detected 93 different mutations in 68 patients with resistance mutations, including 23 cases of T315I, by low-sensitivity techniques (Sanger sequencing).\n\nWe now have a far more sensitive method involving the use of Next Generation Sequencing, coupled with very high fidelity Polymerase Chain Reactions offering new perspectives.\n\nCD8+ T cells are classically involved in tumor control. This has led to a promising new approach to the treatment of tumors: immunotherapy targeting inhibitory receptors or \"immune checkpoints\" (CTLA4, PD1 or its ligand PDL1 for example). These are negative feedback pathways set up following prolonged T cell activation. When T lymphocytes are stimulated over long periods they begin to express this type of receptor on their surface. These inhibitory receptors inhibit T cell functioning and proliferation. Antibodies targeting these receptors block this negative feedback pathway, thereby enhancing T cell activity. Because lymphocytes directed against tumor antigens overexpress these inhibitory receptors, administration of antibodies targeting them can enhance anti-tumor immune activity and, in some patients, induce tumor regression.\n\nClassically, the presence of a type T315I mutation is associated with an explosive increase in the rates of BcrAbl1 linked to a progression of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. This was also the case for other mutations like E255K. Thus, we have a few cases of \"atypical\" T315I with BcrAbl1 levels lower than or equal to 1% and a percentage of T315I close to 100% for more than one year or a patient with a BcrAbl1 level of around 1% for more than 2 years and carrying a T315I at 5%.\n\nSo it seems that the mere presence of certain mutations such as T315I does not explain the progression of the disease alone. This explosive progression might be linked to a second event (at least) specific to the leukemic cell, such as the mutation of another gene (not yet described) or linked to the environment of the leukemic cell, such as control by the immune system.\n\nThe \"atypical\" evolution of these TKI resistance mutations, particularly T315I, which is as frequent as it is frightening, could be controlled by these innate CD8+ T cells. This would explain the long periods (up to more than 2 years documented) of the presence of clones carrying these mutations with no marked disease progression, except, exclusively on a molecular level, a BcrAbl1 level close to 1%.\n\nThe aim of this project is to test whether low levels of BcrAbl1, despite the presence of resistance mutations, are related to high levels of innate CD8+ T cells, in the hypothesis that these cells have an anti-tumor role. This research aims to investigate:\n\n* An association between the rate of innate CD8+ T cells and the evolution of Phi+ pathologies (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute lymphocytic leukemia (Phi+ ALL) carrying a resistance mutation, according to the ELN 2013 and PFi-LMC recommendations.\n* An association between the level of innate CD8+ T cells and the expansion of TKI resistance clones, assessed as the number of BcrAbl1 copies carrying the mutation relative to the number of Abl1 copies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia","Myelogenous Leukemia","Chronic Leukemia","BCR-ABL Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia"],"keywords":["Leukemia","Myelogenous Leukemia","Chronic Leukemia","BCR-ABL Positive","innate CD8+ T cells","Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute lymphocytic leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"For patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Phi+ hematological malignancy (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Phi+ ALL), the remaining whole blood sample taken during the usual management will be sent to the Immunology Laboratory at Nîmes University Hospital for phenotyping of CD8+ TL (total and innate) by flow cytometry.

Samples will be screened for their sensitivity to preselected, clinically accessible targeted agents in an ex vivo culture system. Results for the high-risk patients will be subjected to the tumor broad for evaluation.\n\nProject 2: Fully human antibody candidates identified by phage display will be engineered into therapeutic forms, and assessed for efficacy and safety in patient-derived xenografts of relapsed/refractory B-ALL and in transgenic mice. The mechanisms of action will be identified by single-cell RNA sequencing.\n\nSignificance:\n\nImplementation of functional genomics could identify leukemia patients who will benefit from targeted therapies and enable tailoring of precision medicine.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is considered as the only curative therapy. Unfortunately, conventional transplantation protocol usually has high relapse rate and high nor-relapse mortality. In previous studies, the investigators established a protocol using intensive chemotherapy (cladribine, cytarabine and etoposide) to reduced the leukemia burden followed by reduced intensity conditioning regimen of Flu-Bu3 with 7 day interval. All patients received maintenance therapy. The 1-year relapse rate was less than 20% but toxicity such as lethal infection was documented in sizable part of patients. In this study, the aim is to further evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the protocol with following modifications: 1) dose of cytarabine and etoposide are reduced to 1g/m2 and 100mg/m2 daily; 2) conditioning regimen is based on Flu-Bu2 combined with addition of melphalan (100mg/m2) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in case of contra-indication for busulfan or melphalan; 3) Venetoclax is added to the chemotherapy and conditioning regimen. The modifications intend to reduce both the toxicities and relapse, which may turn into a benefit of disease-free survival (DFS). This is designed as a phase II multi-center prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Refractory

Low gut microbial diversity has been consistently associated with poor outcomes of transplant including increased incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), post-transplant bacterial sepsis and non-relapse mortality (NRM). However, the exact mechanism by which gut microbiome influences local as well as systemic immunity is not completely known, and is thought to be due to the impact of microbial metabolites on intestinal epithelial cells and host antigen-presenting cells. Understanding these mechanisms and modulating the microbiome may be crucial to improving transplant outcomes. Rifaximin is a locally acting antibiotic that has been approved for manipulating the gut microbiome in hepatic failure. It is unique because of its ability to clear pathogenic bacteria, while preserving the anaerobic commensals. It can potentially modify the gut microbiome to increase the alpha diversity and this may help reduce aGVHD, infectious complications, and mortality post-transplant. High incidence of multidrug resistant sepsis and frequent use of broad spectrum antibiotics in India, would result in higher rates of dysbiotic gut- making microbiome manipulation to improve transplant outcomes more relevant in our country. We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to understand the benefits of modulating the gut microbiome in patients of ASCT while investigating the local and global immune repertoire using single cell sequencing and multicolour flow cytometry.\n\nStudy design: Single center, open-labeled, phase II study, randomized controlled trial.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the impact of rifaximin on gut microbial alpha diversity and compare it with controls.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo determine impact of rifaximin on 1 year non relapse mortality post-transplant, incidence of grade III/IV aGVHD, incidence of MDR sepsis, patterns of immune cell reconstitution, and cytokine profile post-transplant.\n\nExploratory objective: To use single-cell transcriptomics (SCT) to identify immune cell profiles in gut biopsies post ASCT in order to get insights into the impact of the microbiome on local gut immunity.\n\nStudy population: Adult patients who undergo ASCT at the Tata Memorial Centre.\n\nStudy Methodology in brief: Patients would be randomized to receive either oral tablet rifaximin 200 mg twice daily along with standard posttransplant treatment or to receive standard of care treatment alone. Stool samples and blood samples will be collected at different time points for microbiome analysis and immune cell profiling respectively. We plan to perform 16s rRNA-based next-generation sequencing of all variable regions using a phased primer approach using stool DNA as a template. Gut microbiome diversity will be calculated using the inverse Simpson index. Immune cell profile would be analyzed using 16 color flow cytometry. In selected cases where patients undergo colonoscopic gut biopsy for aGVHD, we will also obtain samples for transcriptome sequencing. This will help us understand how immune cells interact with gut mucosa and microbiome in patients of aGVHD"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Leukemia"],"keywords":["Rifaximin","Gut Microbiome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Interventional Arm : Tab Rifaximin 200 mg along with allogeneic stem cell transplant\n\nStandard Arm : Allogeneic stem cell transplant alone (with no anti-microbial prophylaxis)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":166,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tab Rifaximin with Allogeneic stem cell transplant","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tab Rifaximin 200 mg will be given orally twice daily from day -8 to day +60 of allogeneic stem cell transplant in acute leukemia patients.

Additional support services may be delivered if requested or if a doctor thinks it is necessary.\n\nLittle research has been done looking at the psychological and physical consequences of being diagnosed with and treated for acute leukemia, but our research team has found that a significant number of these individuals experience symptoms of traumatic stress and severe physical symptoms. Even less research has been done looking at ways to help alleviate this psychological and physical distress. Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE) is an integrated psychosocial and early palliative care (symptom control) intervention designed to reduce psychological distress and physical symptom burden in patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia. The EASE intervention provides i) tailored supportive psychotherapy (called EASE-psy) during the initial weeks of treatment to reduce symptoms of traumatic stress, and ii) symptom screening during the initial inpatient treatment period with triggered referral to early palliative care (symptom control) to help manage moderate to severe physical symptoms (called EASE-phys).\n\nA phase II trial of EASE in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia demonstrated feasibility and preliminary evidence that it reduces psychological distress and physical symptom severity compared to usual care.

Fortunately, significant improvements have been found in response rates, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) for patients with Ph+ ALL with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy to treatment regimens. Based on improvements in efficacy and tolerability, next-generation TKIs have been widely used in first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Flumatinib, a TKI with more potent binding affinity for BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase than imatinib, demonstrated higher rates of responses, faster and deeper responses in FESTnd trial, which suggested that flumatinib might show improved clinical efficacy for treating Ph+ ALL compared with imatinib. The investigators therefore hypothesized that the addition of flumatinib to combinatorial chemotherapy regimen would demonstrate greater efficacy compared with the prior use of imatinib in treating Ph+ ALL.
